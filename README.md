*Very important that if you believe you are experiencing such to see an Expert. I have a DNA test that happened to have Leigh Like Show up, but that was only due to a Seperate Medical Complication that happened to share similarities with the complication. As DNA tests are only a generalized search in the scope of your symptoms at the time of the request. And was very lucky to find out as I thought what I was experiencing was normal even though I knew the opposite.*
# Leigh Like Mitochondrial Syndrome Self Management for the Survivor to Thriver

The Main Barrier for me wanting to go public with this in my own career as a Professional is whether this effects my judgement in prospects to self determination. As this syndrome is incurable, but manageable. I am also in a giant window of uncertainty as to the effects of going through so many regression periods in my life. Which has turned out to be my Strength of Weakness as the only kindness to the Syndrome. Is that when you have to relearn everything over and over again. You get very efficient at connecting the dots.

Thus I need to state this: *This Syndrome does not effect Intelligence,* only the foundational automatics and short term memory being one of them. There is an irony in certain sayings in regards to finding peace with oneself in regards to breath. The difficulty with that saying, is it assumes your ability to automatically breath isn't being interrupted by an aura migraine that is making it difficult to walk or talk coherently. That's long behind me thanks to this Self Maintenance and it may just be Me with this specific mutation and One I can't even Pass On. Remember to Speak to your Doctor if you are concerned.

My specific mutation causes a deficiency of biotin within my mitochondria and as a simplification. But have to wait for Science to catch up for Us in this Camp. I do want you to know. As I took this for granted. Other people do not experience headaches like they are millions of burning needles. It sounds the same to you, head ache, but it's not how other people experience that. It's a burning migraine due to too much lactic acid being built up and causing strain on your mitochondria shredding the surrounding neurons/fibers. 

## Routine
Consult your Doctor. The main issue with this approach is having to be gentle with vitamin dosages. And hypersensitivity allergic reactions can become an issue. I advice a very light antihistamine to counteract. 
* Biotin 5000mcg Extended Release 3x a Day with a 7 hour on average length of effectiveness (Using Hair Vitamins for this, only supplement on the market with Extended Release)
* B1 3x a Day 50mg every 5 hours and 10mg every 6
* Vitamin E 268mg once a day in morning
* CoQ10 100mg once in the morning alongside vitamin E to help absorb
* Lion's Mane Capsules Once a Day
* Magnesium Once a Day, but if legs feel like they are cramping a half dose resolves
* Ashwaghanda Once a Day, this is to relieve overactive adrenals from surviving
* PB8 - Any Probiotics, helps relieve gas and maintain a healthy gut due to the dosing b vitamins
* 1 Scoop Creatine Once a Day also Drink more Water
* CBD and Co as Needed
  * I find CBD is good for relieving the burning sensation and anxiety from migraines
  * CBG specifically for Aura Migraines, though be careful with this dosage as it interacts with Serotonin

The Goal is to Feel Clear as you Can.
I highly suggest exercise to maintain strength is foundational to encourage neurogenesis elements to maintain their own regrowth from regression. As your main objective is to find a balance of routine that works for you. So sitting outside the fire, but can step into such if you need to get work done. Otherwise rest the moment you start to feel burnout take effect. As the cost of such is not worth it. While I am lucky to know how to manage myself and thankfully full access to the internet allowed me to dive into research material. There was no how to and the only supportive doctors I had were my cardiologists in the beginning of this journey.

Hopefully this will be resolved through a Personalized Medication Revolution of Sorts. But for those with the means to find the needle in the haystack for this unfortunate Syndrome. You are not alone. I survived and am thriving when I shouldn't be. Beat back the passage of time with any tool you can find that helps, not distracts from your journey. As we are not afforded the same comfort of the passage of time as everyone else.

## My Symptoms
* Burning Migraine Constant this is something I was born into and the best way to explain the sensation. Feels Similar to Depression, except I knew exactly what to do to help myself, but all Actions to help myself would end up Burning Myself. And have experienced many Breakthroughs because of this strain, but it ultimately results in a Debt of Burnout that is quite literal. 
* I presented young with multiple learning disabilities, and not quite sure why I never received the diagnosis all markers where pointing towards Autism. But because of tests, one in which I bombed on purpose to avoid increased homework my friends were warning me about. Purposefully placing myself in the Just smart enough category to not be helped and was shuffled in the in-between.
* Insomnia was definitely the most persistent side effect of the syndrome when untreated with CBD. As to a normal person, it wouldn't feel like anything. But for me, due to the familiarity with the Pain. I know quickly if there is any real relief or a placebo. As I have tried everything under the Sun. And what has survived this list, is everything that has brought any relief from a terrible situation.
* Regression - Is more akin to a Wall where on One side I have what I can do outwardly that gets worse over time with lack of practice and internally the knowledge of what I can do that gets better over time
* Icepick Migraines
* Weakness
* Palpitations
* Difficulty Breathing
* Aura Migraines that can feel like a Magnet being Dragged along a Television Screen and Can Like your Mind is being Crushed to the Side of your Skull
* Loss of Coordination
* Tremors
* Restless leg
* Difficulty Settling
* Irritability
* Anxiety
* Depression
* Difficulty with Eye Coordination
* ETC

## The Glitch
All of this Comes with my Own Personal Glitch.
As I am Autistic my mind has an increased amount of reelin that is a natural resistence towards the effects of my syndrome.
And because my Mind is Perpectually in Regression.
In combination with all my Thoughts being Uncomortable due to the Syndrome so that choice between pushing beyond frustration of learning and any other thought is the same.
We Speak to Survival of the Fittest, in that Case my Intelligence is my Path towards Survival.
